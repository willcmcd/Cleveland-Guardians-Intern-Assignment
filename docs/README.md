# Cleveland-Guardians-Intern-Assignment
My implementation of assignment for Cleveland Guardians internship opprotunity.

# Provided Documentation:
### Software Engineering Intern Assignment  
Build an ESPN/MLB like game feed using MLB Data. Feel free to use those sites as inspiration 
for your solution! 
A few pieces of additional info: 
- https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball provides access to MLB data or you can access the 
MLB stats API (https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/teams). Docs are restricted, but there 
many public wrappers that provide more information on the API such as 
https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI/wiki 
- Build as a responsive SPA application, should look intentionally designed for both 
mobile and desktop form factors 
- Build the application using a modern JS Framework (Vue, React, Angular, Next JS) in 
Typescript. (Our tech stack is Vue) 

provided as a [PDF](./docs/Software_Engineering_Intern_Assignment.pdf).
